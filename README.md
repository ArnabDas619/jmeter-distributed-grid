# JMeter Distributed Testing POC
This project demonstrates a modernized approach to performance testing by migrating from static on-premise VMs to a dynamic, containerized infrastructure.

### Key Features:
* Scalable Architecture: One JMeter Master with 'N' configurable Load Generator Slaves.
* Zero-Configuration Monitoring: Automated data pipeline from JMeter to InfluxDB.
* Visual Observability: Pre-configured Grafana dashboards for real-time analysis.
* Portability: Define your entire testing lab as code using Docker Compose.
